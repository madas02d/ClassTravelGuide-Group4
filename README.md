Lisbon:
Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world[5] and the second-oldest European capital city (after Athens), predating other modern European capitals by centuries.[6] Settled by pre-Celtic tribes and later founded and civilized by the Phoenicians, Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia,[7] adding the term to the name Olissipo. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it was ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century, most notably the Visigoths. Later it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century. In 1147 Afonso Henriques conquered the city and in 1255 it became Portugal's capital, replacing Coimbra.[8] It has since been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country. 

New York:
New York, often called New York City[b] or simply NYC, is the most populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county. New York is a global center of finance[10] and commerce, culture and technology,[11] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[12] and the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, is an important center for international diplomacy.[13][14][15][16][17] New York City is the center of the world's principal metropolitan economy.[18]
