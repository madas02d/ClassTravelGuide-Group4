Lisbon:
Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world[5] and the second-oldest European capital city (after Athens), predating other modern European capitals by centuries.[6] Settled by pre-Celtic tribes and later founded and civilized by the Phoenicians, Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia,[7] adding the term to the name Olissipo. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it was ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century, most notably the Visigoths. Later it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century. In 1147 Afonso Henriques conquered the city and in 1255 it became Portugal's capital, replacing Coimbra.[8] It has since been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.
